User: what is (are) hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency ? Bot:,"hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (also called vodi) is a hereditary disorder of the liver and immune system. its signs and symptoms appear after the first few months of life. hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a condition that blocks (occludes) small veins in the liver, disrupting blood flow in this organ. this condition can lead to enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), a buildup of scar tissue (hepatic fibrosis), and liver failure. children with vodi are prone to recurrent infections caused by certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people. these infections are usually serious and may be life-threatening. in most people with vodi, infections occur before hepatic veno-occlusive disease becomes evident. many people with vodi live only into childhood, although some affected individuals have lived to early adulthood."

User: what are the genetic changes related to triple x syndrome ?

User: what are the genetic changes related to feingold syndrome ? Bot:,"mutations in the mycn gene cause feingold syndrome. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. studies in animals suggest that this protein is necessary for normal development of the limbs, heart, kidneys, nervous system, digestive system, and lungs. the mycn protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of dna. on the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor. mutations in the mycn gene that cause feingold syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional mycn protein. as a result, only half the normal amount of this protein is available to control the activity of specific genes during embryonic development. it remains unclear how a reduced amount of the mycn protein causes the specific features of feingold syndrome."

User: what is (are) trisomy 2 mosaicism ? Bot:,"trisomy 2 mosaicism is a rare chromosome condition caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 2 in a subset of a persons cells. many cases of trisomy 2 mosaicism result in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage during pregnancy. in live born infants, signs and symptoms vary widely but generally include poor growth of the baby while in the womb and multiple birth defects. trisomy 2 mosaicism may be encountered during pregnancy as a finding following chorionic villus sampling. in these situations the trisomic cells are most often confined to the placenta and the pregnancy results in a healthy infant. further investigation is warranted however, because in a small percentage of cases this finding is associated with an increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. questions regarding trisomy 2 mosaicism should be discussed with a genetic professional. click here to visit genetests to search for a genetics professional near you."

User: what are the genetic changes related to lactose intolerance ?

User: what is (are) legg-calv-perthes disease ? Bot:,"legg-calv-perthes disease is a bone disorder that affects the hips. usually, only one hip is involved, but in about 10 percent of cases, both hips are affected. legg-calv-perthes disease begins in childhood, typically between ages 4 and 8, and affects boys more frequently than girls. in this condition, the upper end of the thigh bone, known as the femoral head, breaks down. as a result, the femoral head is no longer round and does not move easily in the hip socket, which leads to hip pain, limping, and restricted leg movement. the bone eventually begins to heal itself through a normal process called bone remodeling, by which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. this cycle of breakdown and healing can recur multiple times. affected individuals are often shorter than their peers due to the bone abnormalities. many people with legg-calv-perthes disease go on to develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis in the hips at an early age."

User: what are the genetic changes related to sost-related sclerosing bone dysplasia ? Bot:,"sost-related sclerosing bone dysplasia is caused by mutations in or near the sost gene. the sost gene provides instructions for making the protein sclerostin. sclerostin is produced in osteocytes, which are a type of bone cell. the main function of sclerostin is to stop (inhibit) bone formation. mutations in the sost gene that cause sclerosteosis prevent the production of any functional sclerostin. a lack of sclerostin disrupts the inhibitory role it plays during bone formation, causing excessive bone growth. sost mutations that cause van buchem disease result in a shortage of functional sclerostin. this shortage reduces the protein's ability to inhibit bone formation, causing the excessive bone growth seen in people with van buchem disease."

User: is x-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 inherited ?

User: what is (are) hypoplastic right heart syndrome ? Bot:,"hypoplastic right heart syndrome is a rare heart defect, present at birth (congenital), that results in low blood oxygen levels. it is caused by underdevelopment of the structures on the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonary valve, and pulmonary artery) and commonly associated with atrial septal defect. the underdeveloped right side of the heart is unable to provide enough blood flow to the body, leading to low blood oxygen and cyanosis. it differs from hypoplastic left heart syndrome which involves the underdevelopment of the structures on the left side of the heart."
"User: is x-linked intellectual disability, siderius type inherited ? Bot:","this condition is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. in males (who have only one x chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. in females (who have two x chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by x-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. a characteristic of x-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass x-linked traits to their sons."

User: what causes mnire's disease ? Bot:,"what causes mnire's disease? the underlying cause of mnire's disease is unknown, although it probably results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. possible factors that have been studied include viral infections; trauma to the middle ear; middle ear infection (otitis media); head injury; a hereditary predisposition; syphilis; allergies; abnormal immune system responses; migraines; and noise pollution. the symptoms of mnire's disease are thought to relate to changes in fluid volume in the inner ear, which contains structures necessary for normal hearing and balance. changes in fluid volume may disrupt signals sent from the inner ear to the brain, or may lead to tears or ruptures of the structures that affect hearing and balance. more detailed information about the causes of symptoms associated with mnire's disease is available on nidcd's web site."
