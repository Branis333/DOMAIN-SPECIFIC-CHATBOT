## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "Branis333/symptom-gpt2-chatbot"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
model.eval()

# Generate response
question = "I have fever and cough. What could this be?"
prompt = f"User: {question} Bot:"

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=150,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
answer = response.split("Bot:")[-1].strip()
print(answer)
```

## üí° Example Queries

### Symptom Analysis
```
User: I have fever and cough. What could this be?
Bot: You may be experiencing a respiratory infection...
```

### Disease Information
```
User: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Bot: Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination...
```

## üìÅ Dataset Sources

1. **Kaggle Symptom-Disease Dataset** - Disease descriptions, symptom mappings, precautions
2. **MedQuAD** - Expert-curated medical Q&A from multiple domains

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Not a Medical Professional**: Cannot replace professional medical advice
2. **Training Data Bias**: Limited to information in training data
3. **Hallucination Risk**: May generate plausible but incorrect information
4. **Language**: Primarily English medical texts

## üîí Ethical Considerations

- **Informational Only**: Should not be used for self-diagnosis
- **Professional Consultation Required**: Always seek medical professionals for health concerns
- **Verification**: Cross-check any medical information with reliable sources
